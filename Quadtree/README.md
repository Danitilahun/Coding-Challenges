# Quadtree Polygon Search

This project demonstrates how to use a quadtree data structure to efficiently find points within a dynamically drawn polygon. The script leverages `matplotlib` for interactive polygon creation, allowing users to define a polygon by clicking on a plot and then identifying points within that polygon.

## Project Structure
- `quadtree_polygon_search.py`: Python script to build a quadtree, insert points, and search for points within a polygon.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `shapely`

You can install all dependencies with the command below.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the main script to see a demonstration of points within a polygon being highlighted.

 ```bash
python quadtree_polygon_search.py
